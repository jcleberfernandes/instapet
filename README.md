# InstaPet 🐾

A social media platform for pet lovers — share photos, follow other pet owners, like and comment on posts, and discover new animals through hashtags.

Built as the final project for **Project I — Web Programming**, ETIC_Algarve, Academic Year 2025/26 (Class 2527, Group 4, Path A).

## Original Design Reference

This project is the functional MVP of the **InstaPet** concept developed during the Web Design module. The original static design (Figma prototype) served as the visual source of truth for layout, colour palette, typography, and component structure throughout development.

**Figma prototype:** [InstaPet — ETIC](https://www.figma.com/design/dWD3WxgGIOKWSLXl5SeXYp/InstaPet-ETIC?node-id=1-13971&t=bGMq0WooFih2My55-1)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS · Web Components · HTML/CSS |
| Backend | Python 3.12 · FastAPI · SQLModel |
| Database | SQLite |
| Auth | JWT (HS256) · bcrypt |
| Runtime | Docker · Docker Compose · nginx |
| Package manager | uv |

> **Why FastAPI instead of Django?** FastAPI was chosen for its lightweight footprint and native async support, which made it easier to build and reason about each endpoint individually — aligned with the learning goal of understanding what every line of code does.

> **Why SQLite?** The project scope fits comfortably within SQLite's capabilities. Using a file-based database also simplifies the Docker setup (no separate database container needed) and keeps the data model easy to inspect and reset during development.

## Features

- **Authentication** — register, login, JWT-protected routes, password show/hide toggle
- **Feed** — chronological feed with filter widget (all posts vs. following only) and explore (posts from unfollowed users)
- **Posts** — create posts with caption, hashtags, and required image upload; edit and delete own posts
- **Likes & Saves** — like or bookmark any post; saved posts sorted by save date and accessible from profile
- **Comments** — add and delete comments per post
- **Profiles** — avatar, bio, Gostos/Seguidores/A seguir counters, post grid with tabs (posts / saved)
- **Follow system** — follow/unfollow from feed postcards, search, and profile; optimistic counter updates with rollback
- **Followers/following popup** — click follower or following count to open a modal list of users with inline follow buttons
- **Notifications** — real-time badge on navbar; triggered by likes, comments, and follows; auto-marked as read on panel open; clear all
- **Hashtag links** — `#tag` in any caption becomes a clickable link to search results
- **Tag filtering** — right sidebar shows trending tags; click to filter the feed
- **Search** — search posts by hashtag; follow users directly from results
- **404 page** — custom branded page for unknown routes
- **Image uploads** — JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP, max 10 MB, served as static files
- **Terms & FAQ** — dedicated page in Portuguese with accordion FAQ

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2
- `make`
or
use the dev container

### Environment variables

`make start` generates `backend/.env` automatically with a random `JWT_SECRET` if the file does not already exist. No manual step is needed.

If you want to set your own secret before the first run:

```env
# backend/.env
JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
```

### Run locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SRamoras/instapet.git
cd instapet

# Generate .env (if missing), build images, start containers, seed the database
make start
```

The app will be available at:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 |
| Interactive API docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### Makefile reference

```makefile
sync:
	cd backend && uv sync

gen-env:
	@if [ ! -f backend/.env ]; then \
		echo "JWT_SECRET=$$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > backend/.env; \
	fi

start:
	$(MAKE) gen-env
	cd backend && uv sync
	@if [ -d backend/instapet.db ]; then rm -rf backend/instapet.db; fi
	@touch backend/instapet.db
	docker compose down --remove-orphans
	docker compose build --no-cache
	docker compose up -d
	docker compose exec -T backend uv run python -m app.database.seed

seed:
	docker compose exec -T backend uv run python -m app.database.seed

build:
	docker compose up -d --build

restart:

## AI Usage

> This section is required by the Project I brief (NFR-07, section 10). All AI-assisted work is declared below. Every line of code in this repository was read, understood, and verified by the student who committed it before being merged.

### Tool used

**Claude Code** (Anthropic) — AI coding assistant used interactively throughout the project via the CLI.

**ChatGPT** (OpenAI) — used for research, concept clarification, and exploring alternative approaches

### Declaration by area

| Area | Purpose | Rough scope |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Backend project structure | Scaffolding the FastAPI folder layout (routers/, models/, schemas/, auth/) and wiring the app entry point (`main.py`) | Initial scaffold; manually adjusted throughout |
| SQLModel data models | First draft of `User`, `Post`, `Like`, `Save`, `Comment`, `Follow`, `Tag`, `PostTag`, `Notification` models and their field types/constraints | AI-drafted, reviewed and corrected by Diogo |
| JWT authentication | Implementation of `hash_password`, `verify_password`, `create_access_token`, `decode_access_token` in `auth/jwt.py` and the `get_current_user` dependency |  AI-drafted |
| FastAPI routers | First pass of all CRUD endpoints in `routers/posts.py`, `routers/users.py`, `routers/auth.py`; `enrich_post` and `enrich_user` helper pattern (now in `services/`) | AI-drafted, then debugged and extended manually |
| Security hardening | Identifying that `JWT_SECRET` was hardcoded → moved to `os.environ["JWT_SECRET"]`; flagging `innerHTML` XSS risk → replaced with `textContent`/`createElement`; removing debug logs | Identified by Claude, applied and verified by Diogo |
| Web Components (frontend) | Initial shell of `<post-card>`, `<feed-sidebar-left>`, `<feed-sidebar-right>`, `<post-form>`, `<nav-bar>` and others using the native Web Components API | AI-drafted, styled and adjusted by Cléber |
| JS service layer | First draft of `services/api.js`, `auth.js`, `posts.js`, `users.js`, `upload.js`, `notifications.js` — thin wrappers around `fetch` | AI-drafted, reviewed and extended by Cléber |
| Custom DOM events | Pattern for inter-component communication (`post-submit`, `post-like`, `post-save`, `sidebar-follow-change`) | Suggested by Claude, implemented and tested manually |
| Bug fixes | Diagnosing stale-data navigation bug → `feed-stale` sessionStorage flag + `pageshow` handler; follow count live-update without reload | Root cause identified by Claude, fix written and verified manually |
| Docker & Makefile | `docker-compose.yml` structure, `Dockerfile` for each service, `makefile` targets | AI-drafted, tested and corrected locally |
| CSS design tokens | Applying consistent CSS custom properties across all components | Suggested by Claude, applied and validated visually by Cléber |
| README | Drafting and structuring this README, API table, and AI Usage section | AI-drafted, reviewed and edited by both authors |
| Seed data | First draft of `app/database/seed.py` content — pet usernames, bios, post captions, comments, follow/notification sample data | AI-drafted, reviewed and edited by both authors |

### How AI was used as a learning aid

- Claude was used conversationally: we described what we wanted to build, read and questioned the output, then modified it before committing. Anything we couldn't explain we either researched until we could, or rewrote ourselves.
- When Claude proposed a pattern we hadn't seen before (e.g., `enrich_post` helper in `services/`, `asynccontextmanager` for FastAPI lifespan), we asked it to explain why before accepting the code.
- Security issues were flagged by Claude during code review prompts — this reinforced understanding of JWT secret management and XSS risks rather than bypassing it.
- No code was committed with the reasoning "the AI wrote it" — the commit history reflects iterative, understood changes.

### What was done without AI assistance

- Project concept, feature scope, and design decisions
- Visual design direction, colour palette, and Figma artefact (Web Design module)
- Git branching strategy, pull request reviews, and merge decisions
- Integration testing and manual QA of all user flows
- Final debugging sessions where Claude's suggestions were incorrect and discarded
