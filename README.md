# InstaPet 🐾

A social media platform for pet lovers — share photos, follow other pet owners, like and comment on posts, and discover new animals through hashtags.

Built as the final project for **Project I — Web Programming**, ETIC_Algarve, Academic Year 2025/26 (Class 2527, Group 4, Path A).

## Authors & Contributions

| Student | Primary responsibilities |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Diogo Silva** | Backend (FastAPI routers, authentication, data models, upload), Docker setup, API design, security hardening |
| **Cléber Fernandes** | Frontend (Web Components, feed layout, UI styling, design system), search and profile pages |

Both members contributed to integration, testing, and Git workflow throughout the project.

## Original Design Reference

This project is the functional MVP of the **InstaPet** concept developed during the Web Design module. The original static design (Figma prototype) served as the visual source of truth for layout, colour palette, typography, and component structure throughout development.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS · Web Components · HTML/CSS |
| Backend | Python 3.12 · FastAPI · SQLModel |
| Database | SQLite |
| Auth | JWT (HS256) · bcrypt |
| Runtime | Docker · Docker Compose · nginx |
| Package manager | uv |

> **Why FastAPI instead of Django?** FastAPI was chosen for its lightweight footprint and native async support, which made it easier to build and reason about each endpoint individually — aligned with the learning goal of understanding what every line of code does.

> **Why SQLite?** The project scope fits comfortably within SQLite's capabilities. Using a file-based database also simplifies the Docker setup (no separate database container needed) and keeps the data model easy to inspect and reset during development.

## AI Usage

> This section is required by the Project I brief (NFR-07, section 10). All AI-assisted work is declared below. Every line of code in this repository was read, understood, and verified by the student who committed it before being merged.

### Tool used

**Claude Code** (Anthropic) — AI coding assistant used interactively throughout the project via the CLI.

### Declaration by area

| Area | Purpose | Rough scope |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Backend project structure | Scaffolding the FastAPI folder layout (routers/, models/, schemas/, auth/) and wiring the app entry point (`main.py`) | Initial scaffold; manually adjusted throughout |
| SQLModel data models | First draft of `User`, `Post`, `Like`, `Save`, `Comment`, `Follow`, `Tag`, `PostTag` models and their field types/constraints | ~80% AI-drafted, reviewed and corrected by Diogo |
| JWT authentication | Implementation of `hash_password`, `verify_password`, `create_access_token`, `decode_access_token` in `auth/jwt.py` and the `get_current_user` dependency | ~70% AI-drafted |
| FastAPI routers | First pass of all CRUD endpoints in `routers/posts.py`, `routers/users.py`, `routers/auth.py`; `_enrich_post` and `_enrich_user` helper pattern | AI-drafted, then debugged and extended manually |
| Security hardening | Identifying that `JWT_SECRET` was hardcoded → moved to `os.environ["JWT_SECRET"]`; flagging `innerHTML` XSS risk → replaced with `textContent`/`createElement`; removing debug logs | Identified by Claude, applied and verified by Diogo |
| Web Components (frontend) | Initial shell of `<post-card>`, `<feed-sidebar-left>`, `<feed-sidebar-right>`, `<post-form>`, `<nav-bar>` and others using the native Web Components API | ~60% AI-drafted, styled and adjusted by Cléber |
| JS service layer | First draft of `services/api.js`, `posts.js`, `users.js`, `upload.js` — thin wrappers around `fetch` | AI-drafted, reviewed and extended by Cléber |
| Custom DOM events | Pattern for inter-component communication (`post-submit`, `post-like`, `post-save`, `sidebar-follow-change`) | Suggested by Claude, implemented and tested manually |
| Bug fixes | Diagnosing stale-data navigation bug → `feed-stale` sessionStorage flag + `pageshow` handler; follow count live-update without reload | Root cause identified by Claude, fix written and verified manually |
| Docker & Makefile | `docker-compose.yml` structure, `Dockerfile` for each service, `makefile` targets | AI-drafted, tested and corrected locally |
| CSS design tokens | Applying consistent CSS custom properties across all components | Suggested by Claude, applied and validated visually by Cléber |
| README | Drafting and structuring this README, API table, and AI Usage section | AI-drafted, reviewed and edited by both authors |

### How AI was used as a learning aid

- Claude was used conversationally: we described what we wanted to build, read and questioned the output, then modified it before committing. Anything we couldn't explain we either researched until we could, or rewrote ourselves.
- When Claude proposed a pattern we hadn't seen before (e.g., `_enrich_post` helper, `asynccontextmanager` for FastAPI lifespan), we asked it to explain why before accepting the code.
- Security issues were flagged by Claude during code review prompts — this reinforced understanding of JWT secret management and XSS risks rather than bypassing it.
- No code was committed with the reasoning "the AI wrote it" — the commit history reflects iterative, understood changes.

### What was done without AI assistance

- Project concept, feature scope, and design decisions
- Visual design direction, colour palette, and Figma artefact (Web Design module)
- Content for the seed database (pet usernames, bios, post captions)
- Git branching strategy, pull request reviews, and merge decisions
- Integration testing and manual QA of all user flows
- Final debugging sessions where Claude's suggestions were incorrect and discarded
